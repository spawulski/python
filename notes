Project
scraping
  back from today, to the start
  Don't hard code 1996 into the code
  start with current month somehow
  Try using a while loop for the year
db
  pretty straightforward
plotting
  figure it out
  make a basic box plot
  make sure the plot you make has all the lables intact and it looks like the example
  box plot does math for us, just pass it lists of data
  
  Bonus: display line plot from a month x axis becomes days instead of months

userinteraction
  FOR SURE SURE __name__ == __main__ this one
  promt user to download everything, or just do an update.
  Be really specific with user options.

Package
  pixabay = free pictures dont even need to attribute them
  open source licence agreements = opensource.org licences MIT is good option

  He wants us to instal pytest and pytest-pep8
  py.test --pep8 scrape_weather.py
